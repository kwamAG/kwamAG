# Hello,

I work with my hands during the day and tinker with code, circuits, and ideas the rest of the time. I’m drawn to the places where physical work meets technology — welding automation, robotics, mini computers, AI tools that will change how we operate.

## What I’m Into

- **Industrial automation & robotics** — especially welding robots and how AI is changing fabrication
- **Mini computers & embedded systems** — Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and getting them to do useful things
- **AI & machine learning** — how it works and where it’s headed
- **Data** — collecting it, understanding it, building things with it

## Why I’m Here

Learn by building. This is where I put the projects, experiments, and half-finished ideas that come from asking “what if?”

 — just someone who believes often times the best way to understand something is to take it apart and put it back together.

## Background

Desktop builder/ Pipefitter 

Pipes and programs aren’t that different — both are systems, both need to flow, both break in interesting ways.

*Always learning. Always building.*
